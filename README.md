## 🚀 Getting Started

### Arduino Development

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/)
2. Navigate to the `Arduino/` directory
3. Browse `examples/` for sample projects
4. Install libraries from `libraries/` by copying to your Arduino libraries folder

### ESP32 Development

**Option 1: Arduino Framework (Easier)**
1. Install [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/) or use Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
2. Navigate to the `ESP32/` directory
3. Browse `examples/` for sample projects
4. Use libraries from `libraries/` in your projects

**Option 2: ESP-IDF Framework (Advanced)**
1. Install [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/) (version 4.4 or later)
2. Set up the ESP-IDF environment
3. Navigate to the `ESP-IDF/` directory
4. Copy libraries to your project's `components/` directory
5. Use advanced FreeRTOS features and ESP32 capabilities

### Common Libraries

The `Common/libraries/` directory contains platform-independent or cross-compatible code that can be used across different development boards.
